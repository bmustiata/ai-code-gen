Create an utility program in pure C that can list folders. The program should
be able to list folders first, and files after.

Program Flags:
* `-l` flag, that when enabled it would make the program list
  the files with extra data if it's folder, link, etc and its file size.
* `--color/--no-color`. When enabled the folders will be displayed with blue, and executable
  files would be displayed with green.

It must have a README file where you explain the usage and build of the project.

ANSI coloring terminal support should be kept in its own file.

The project should be buildable with CMake.

Make sure headers are also generated for non-main C files.
