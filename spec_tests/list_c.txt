Create a utility program in pure C that can list folders.

The program should list folders first, and files after. The output format should be for simple listing:

```
folderA
folderB
folderC
file1
file2
file3
```

For extendend (`-l`) listing:

```
d folderA   -
d folderB   -
d folderC   -
f file1     32
f file2     124
f file3     0
```

Program Flags:
* `-l` flag, that when enabled it would make the program list
  the files with extra data if it's folder, link, etc and its file size.
* `--color/--no-color`. When enabled the folders will be displayed with blue, and executable
  files would be displayed with green.

It must have a README file where you explain the usage and build of the project.

ANSI coloring terminal support should be kept in its own file.

The project should be buildable with CMake.

Make sure headers are also generated for non-main C files.
