Create the following projects:
1. a DB SQL schema definition (sql folder), and
2. a FastAPI Python REST endpoint for a document store that's stored in sqlite. Store the python project
   definition in the doc-backend/ folder.

1. Create the DB schema. It should have three tables::
   - collection - contains a set of documents: has an id, title (max 256 chars), and description (max 2048 chars).
   - document - is an actual document from the collection: has a collection_id, id, title (max 256 chars), description (max 2048 chars), publishing date (timestamp including the day + hour)
   - document_part - is a section from the document: has a document_id, id, parent_id (if this document part is a child of another document part, null if it's the root one), parent_order, title (max 256 chars), description (max 2048 chars), content (clob)
2. Create the REST operations, for all three tables:
   a. collection, (never use collections.py since this shadows the built-in collections module)
   b. document and
   c. document_parts.
   Split them in different files.

Don't use any DB framework, just use direct SQL statements against sqlite.

Use the following structure:
- db-schema/*   - schema design document + actual SQLs if needed to create the tables
- doc-backend/* - here's the python FastAPI implementation of the REST endpoint.
- REST.md - document all the rest endpoints here
- SPEC.md - the spec you'll create
- README.md - readme explaining how to setup and run the project
