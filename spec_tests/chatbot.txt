Create a chatbot mock application. The application should be divided into three projects:

1. `chatbot-api`: An API layer, that stores the grpc definitions with the operations to create and end
   a chat, and streaming for the chat messages from the server.
2. `chatbot-web`: A WEB layer written in Vite with Vue3 + TypeScript. This would have a page for the current
   conversation with an agent. The user can pick one of the agents from the combo
   The UI is made with PatternFly for styling. The messages are to be rendered as markdown.
3. `chatbot-rest`: A REST layer written in Python. This should just mock streaming messages from the
   backend, using a small delay. The conversation management to create/list/delete them
   should also be mocked and only be saved in-process.

The communication between the WEB and REST layers should happen via grpc-web.
