Create a python program named `git_monorepo` that can manage a monorepo made
out of multiple git repos that are checked out and managed somewhere in the
subtree of the current monorepo.

git_monorepo is not a monorepo itself, is just a program that manages a monorepo
project.

## Monorepo Configuration

Such a project would have two files that would tell `git_monorepo` about the
monorepo project:

1. `monorepo.yml` - contains a mapping of folders, with what git repos they
                    should contain in that folder. Here's an example:

```yml
mappings:
  adhesive:
    adhesive: git@github.com:germaniumhq/adhesive.git
    yamldict: git@github.com:bmustiata/yamldict.git
  build: git@github.com:germaniumhq/build-please.git
  oaas:
    registry-api: git@github.com:germaniumhq/oaas-registry-api.git
    registry: git@github.com:germaniumhq/oaas-registry.git
```

This would mean in the current folder we would have:

adhesive/: parent folder
  adhesive/: linked to git@github.com:germaniumhq/adhesive.git
  yamldict/: linked to git@github.com:bmustiata/yamldict.git
build: linked to git@github.com:germaniumhq/build-please.git
oaas/: parent folder
    registry-api/: linked to git@github.com:germaniumhq/oaas-registry-api.git
    registry/: linked to git@github.com:germaniumhq/oaas-registry.git

2. `monorepo.sync` - a yaml file where the `git_monorepo` keeps the current state
                     of the currently checked-out version for each individual
                     git repo included in the `monorepo.yml`

A cache of the used repos is in a `.gitmono` folder where each individual git
repo that `monorepo.yml` makes reference to is locally cached.

## Commands

The program offers the following commands:

init - creates an empty `monorepo.yml` file in the current folder, with
       a single sample `mappings:` entry offered as sample:
       `adhesive: git@github.com:germaniumhq/adhesive.git`.
pull - pulls all folders from the `monorepo.yml` (if no parameters), or
       individual project folders. For example: `git monorepo pull adhesive/adhesive` would
       use the info from the `monorepo_yaml['mappings']['adhesive']['adhesive']` to see the
       remote repo. If a folder isn't yet cloned, it gets cloned. `monorepo.sync` is of
       course updated to match.
push - pushes all the changes into the corresponding repos. This means each
       commit that happened on this monorepo will get recreated for the impacted repos
       for the current branch.
       So if there's 3 commits in the `adhesive/adhesive` folder, three commits,
       each with the individual change would be created on the corresponding git repo
       defined in the `monorepo.yml` (in the example above it would be git@github.com:germaniumhq/adhesive.git).
       If a folder for a repo doesn't have changes, of course it won't create empty commits
       for that repo. `monorepo.sync` is updated to reflect the new commit.
sync - synchronizes all the repos in the `monorepo.yml` with any eventual upstream commits
       that happened in each of the remote repos. Unlike pull this doesn't attempt to recreate the
       history, it simply gets _all_ the changes that were upstream for the current branch, updates
       the `monorepo.sync` with the correct hash for that repo and creates a single commit for the local
       git monorepo.
move - moves a folder from a place to another, and updates the `monorepo.yml`
       and the `monorepo.sync` with the new information.
merge - same like push, it will create a merge across all the repos that are affected by the change
       between the current branch and the referred branch.
       So for example if I'm on the `master` branch, and I do a `git monorepo merge feature/abc`,
       the following will happen:
       1. for each of the internal git repos in the `monorepo.yml` a merge will be created for the
          same branches
       2. the `monorepo.sync` would be updated.
       3. an actual merge would be performed to the other branch, our `monorepo.sync` wins in case of
          conflict, since we just updated it.
help - display information on how to use it.

All `pull`, `push` and `sync` commands allow local folders that are mapped to repos in the `monorepo.yml`.

Break each command into its own python file.

## Branch Management

For all the git monorepo commands the same branch name is used across all the repos, looking
at the currently checked out branch name in the monorepo. This is especially true for when branches
don't exist on the remote git repo. If that's the case and a push needs to create it, it should
create the branch first, before creating the commits.

Use the local cache of the repos from the `.gitmono` when implementing the commands, since it would
otherwise be expensive to always fetch and synchronize hashes in the git graph.
