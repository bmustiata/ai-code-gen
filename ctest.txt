Create an utility program in pure C that can list folders. The program should
be able to list folders first, and files after.

Program Flags:
* `-l` flag, that when enabled it would make the program list
  the files with extra data (if it's folder, link, etc), file size, and last modification
  time.
* `--color/--no-color`. When enabled the folders will be displayed with blue, and executable
  files would be displayed with green.

ANSI coloring terminal support should be kept in its own C file.
