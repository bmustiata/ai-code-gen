Create a FastAPI Python REST endpoint for a document store that's stored in sqlite.
Make a small frontend for it using Vue3 + Vite.

1. Create the DB schema. It should have three tables::
   - collection - contains a set of documents: has an id, title (max 256 chars), and description (max 2048 chars).
   - document - is an actual document from the collection: has a collection_id, id, title (max 256 chars), description (max 2048 chars), publishing date (timestamp including the day + hour)
   - document_part - is a section from the document: has a document_id, id, parent_id (if this document part is a child of another document part, null if it's the root one), parent_order, title (max 256 chars), description (max 2048 chars), content (clob)
2. Create the REST operations, for all three tables:
   a. collection,
   b. documents and
   c. document_parts.
   Split them in different files. Don't use any DB framework, just use direct SQL statements against sqlite.
3. Create a Vue3 frontend that allows doing CRUD operations against the collection, documents and document_parts.

Structure in the following subfolders:
- db_schema/*   - schema design document + actual SQLs if needed to create the tables
- doc-backend/* - here's the python FastAPI implementation of the REST endpoint.
- doc-frontend/* - here's the Vue3 JS implementation of the Web Frontend.
- SPEC.md - the spec you'll create
- README.md - some readme explaining how to run the project
